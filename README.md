# Music for Web Browsers

_Make ambient music in your web browser!_

## Build
This site was built in React using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/). To modify and test the website locally:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate into the project directory and install the Node modules:

```bash
$ cd capstone
$ npm install
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Page components are stored in `src/components`. Many components are packaged with corresponding `.css` styles. Global styles are stored in `src/styles/index.css`.

Audio files can be found in `src/audio`, and any other assets (images, `.svg`s, etc.) are in `src/assets`.

Custom hooks (currently unused) are stored in the `src/hooks` directory, and any plain JS scripts are in `src/scripts`.

## Other Notes

- This site hasn't been tested on mobile and may break (ðŸ˜“).
